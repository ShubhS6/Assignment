1.Create Nginx dockerfile
	1.Set the base image to Ubuntu  
	2.Install Nginx
	3.Install necessary tools: vim wget curl net-tools
	4.Remove the default Nginx configuration file
	5.Copy a configuration file from the current directory
	6.Expose ports (80)
	7.Set the default command to execute when creating a new container


Answere----->
	FROM ubuntu:latest
	RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \nginx \vim \wget \curl\net-tools
	RUN rm -v /nginx/nginx.conf
	COPY nginx.conf /nginx/nginx.conf
	EXPOSE 80
	CMD ["nginx","-g","daemon off;"]



2.Build the docker image and push it to dockerhub.
Answere--->
  	docker build -t docker build -t username/dockerimage
	docker push username/dockerimage	




3.What is the difference between 'RUN', 'CMD', & 'ENTRYPOINT' in dockerfile?
Answere---->
      Run is used during the build phase to execute commands to modify the image and create a new layer.
      CMD is used to specify the default command to be executed when a container is started.	
      ENTRYPOINT specifies the executable to run and can also be overridden with arguments provided at runtime. It is often used when defining the container as an executable.




4.How to remove container automatically after it exits?
Answere---->
	docker run --rm image



5.How to check which containers are connected to a network?
Answere---->
          docker network ls



6.How to check container ip address?
Answere---->
	docker inspect containername


7.How to create custom bridge network?
Answere---->
	docker network create network_name
	



8.How to associate a container with a network?
Answere---->
	docker run -d --name containername --network network_name




9.How to get persistent storage?
Answere--->
	docker volume create mydata
	docker run -d --name containername -v mydata:/path/in/container nginx
